# Introduction 
## Description
This C# web application that represents the functionality of an ECommerce store online, using a login feature, register feature, inventory viewing/purchasing, a shopping cart view, and a transaction view.

```
What is the product you are selling?
Our Ecommerce store currently sells musical instruments and has a special section for musicians of a professional level!

What claims are you capturing? Where? Why?
A users' favorite instrument (because who wouldn't want to share that!) 
and a checkbox that is a boolean that captures whether or not you(the user) are a professional musician, which will grant access to our special deals page(TBD on the release, 
still under development)

What Policies are you enforcing? Where? Why? Directions on how to test.
A policy we are enforcing currently is whether or not you are a musiscian, which will determine whether or not you gain access to our "musicians page" that will grant special 
deals for working musicians.
In order to test, You must create a new user. Before final creation, there is a checkbox for "professional musician". 
Once checked,  should be able to click "Musician" in the nav-bar and depending on what you selected (checked the checkbox or not), you will be granted accessto the page.
